# Emque::Mailer

This is a simple gem whose task is to provide a base class for emails in
Emque::Consuming applications. It attempts to closeishly mimic
ActionMailer::Base's interface.

DISCLAIMER: I have a lot of work to do around this before it's ready for use
by others. Don't try to use it yet unless you're looking to contribute.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "emque-mailer", :git => "https://github.com/sensiblesitters/emque-mailer"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install emque-mailer

## Usage

I recommend not using it.
